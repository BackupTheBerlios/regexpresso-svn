* cool regexes :

/[RegExprso]/g
=> matches all letters of RegExpresso

s/\w+/Malkovitch/g
=> replaces all words with Malkovitch (see Dans la peau de John Malkovitch)

BUGS :

Opera : title is big and empty when hovering the icons when the URL is too long

Opera : first time the warning icons are displayed, they are not loaded -> bug or not ? Opera prints the URL in the title, so it may be because of that

IE : when only empty matches, the result is blank

IE : onhover does not work in table mode

IE : search multiline : lines are kept but there is an additionnal character at the beginning of the line (\r+\n ?)
	=> this is due to a bug in IE : it silently converts \n to \r\n when assigned to a textarea's value (see http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2004/02/16/line-endings-in-javascript)
	This would be solved by using a variable for the textarea, and using the textarea only as a way to modify the value of this variable
	=> Anyway, the handling of line feeds is very tricky and different from one browser to another
